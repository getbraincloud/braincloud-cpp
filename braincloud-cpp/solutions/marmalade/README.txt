This is the brainCloud Marmalade package.


INSTALLATION
------------

1) You will need to grab the latest Marmalade C++ brainCloud client and unzip into your project
folder (so that there is a "brainCloud" folder).

2) Include the following subproject in your mkb file:
 
subprojects
{
    brainCloud
}

Note that some targets (mostly the ones that do not appear to work with the Marmalade curl package)
do not build correctly.


ADDITIONAL NOTES
----------------

Note also that you will need to add the following string to your data/app.icf file:

[Util]
MemMgrTrackTableSize=0

This is required to kill the asserts generated by iw mem mgr.
# as brainCloud networking runs on a seperate thread

This turns off the IwUtil memory management tracking as Iw projects cannot
handle memory being allocated on a seperate thread. brainCloud uses a seperate thread for doing
networking and so if you turn it back on, you'll hit a bunch of memory asserts which are
in fact totally safe.

Note the s3e memory tracker claims to support multiple threads and should thus work.
